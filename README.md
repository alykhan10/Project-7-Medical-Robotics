# Project #7: Medical Robotics
# Prototyping an Articulated Manipulator for Cervical Cancer Detection

● Modelled the robot using 3 spherical wrist joints and 1 prismatic joint to maximize geometric manipulability              
● Sketched the 3D kinematic diagram and parameterized serial links using the Denavit-Hartenberg convention               
● Derived transformation matrices for end-effector position and the Jacobian matrix via MATLAB's robotics toolkit
